## DESCRIPTION:

Billygen takes the data that RDoc collects and dumps it to a readable 
transport format.

Currently only YAML is available; XML and others are trivial to implement and
will be offered if there is a genuine use case.


## SYNOPSIS:

It's just a normal RDoc generator -- use it as you would any other: from the
command-line, from a rake task, etc. Here's an example of using it with
recommended defaults from a script or irb:

    require 'billygen' 
    files = ["README.md", 'lib/**/*.rb']
    Billygen.run('Project Name', 'doc', files)

This will output a file called `rdocdump.yml` in the `doc` directory.

You can also use Billygen to read the dumped file back into Ruby objects:

    require 'billygen'
    @manifest = YAML.load(IO.read("doc/rdocdump.yml"))

    # Then, for example:
    puts @manifest.data['classes'].collect { |klass| klass.name }


## STATUS:

Really early days. Use it to play around with, but don't replace your current
RDoc generator with billygen until a few key bugs are ironed out.

The API for reading billygen output back in will change, and old dumped data
may not continue to be readable by newer billygen versions until we're out
of this early development period.

Ie, give us a few versions to settle things down.


## REQUIREMENTS:

* RDoc >= 2.4


## INSTALL:

For the moment, clone the git repository to your local setup and run:

    $ rake gem:install

We'll package it up as a gem when it's ready.
